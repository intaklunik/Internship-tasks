# Hello World server
## Task
Write your own implementation of forward list. Class must contain:
- Basic operations with forward list: initialization, insertion, iteration, getting size, removing elements. <br/>
- Move operations (move constructor, move assigment operator)
- Class method, that inserts an element to the beggining must have an overloading with parameter of r-value reference. 
- Constructor method with parameter of std::initializer_list.
- It must be a class template, that can work with objects.
- You should aim for an interface of std::forward_list ideally, but it's not necessarily.
- BONUS POINTS: implement method split_when, that divide list in two parts depending on a predicate which pass to function as a parameter.
